# Heart-Failure-Clinical-Data-Kaggle

This project was made from Kaggle data to predict heart failure. This model can be used to early detecting factors that might affect high mortality rate of the heart disease.
I do EDA and several modeling they are logistic regression, random forest, xgboost, and gradient boosting. 
I find the Random Forest to be the best model by acquiring 86.67% of accuracy.
